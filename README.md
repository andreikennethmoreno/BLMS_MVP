  password: z.string().min(1, 'Password is required'),
});

// Registration validation
const registrationSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1, 'Name is required'),
  email: z.string().email('Please enter a valid email address'),
  password: z.string().min(6, 'Password must be at least 6 characters long'),
  confirmPassword: z.string(),
}).refine((data) => data.password === data.confirmPassword, {
  message: "Passwords don't match",
  path: ["confirmPassword"],
});
```

### Property Management Forms

// Property submission validation
const propertySchema = z.object({
  title: z.string().min(1, 'Property title is required'),
  description: z.string().min(10, 'Description must be at least 10 characters'),
  address: z.string().min(1, 'Address is required'),
  images: z.array(z.string().url('Please enter a valid URL')).min(1, 'At least one image is required'),

3. Owner submits property with validated form data
4. Property manager reviews and approves with final rate
5. Contract is automatically generated and sent
6. Owner reviews and accepts contract with form validation
7. Property goes live and becomes bookable

### Booking Process
1. Customer searches properties by date and guest count
2. System shows only available properties
3. Customer selects dates using interactive calendar
4. System validates availability and prevents conflicts
5. Booking is confirmed with payment processing
6. All parties receive confirmation

### Issue Resolution
1. Guest reports concern during active stay with validated form

3. Property manager can create job order if needed
4. Assigned team receives work order with details
5. Progress is tracked until resolution
6. Guest confirms issue resolution

This platform demonstrates a complete property management ecosystem with sophisticated workflows, real-time data management, comprehensive form validation, and excellent user experiences for all stakeholder types.
